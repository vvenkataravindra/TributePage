          <code>Konoha</code> was feeling extremely deserted that day, the reason was <code>'The Week of Mourning'</code> that was being observed due to the death of its leader: <code>Hiruzen Sarutobi</code>.

         

Elsewhere, within the geographical boundaries of the <code>Fire Nation</code>, a 'lab' was situated. It was setup by the assistant of one of the 'legendary Three' of Konoha, <code>Kabuto</code>.


A tired <code>Orochimaru</code> wandered aimlessly for a few miles before actually reaching this lab. His hands were chopped off the rest of his body and he needed them back badly.He was waiting for his assistant/student Kabuto.

Kabuto was running late as he had some 'personal' stuff to be taken care of.He hoped that his master wasn't too frustrated.


A few moments later, he was at his destination, the lab, situated right in the heart of a random forest.

"Greetings, Orochimaru-sama", said Kabuto addressing his master with utmost respect.He liked his teacher a lot. 

"Damn you....", shouted Orochimaru.His tone was a perfect mixture of vengence and pain.

Kabuto froze for a moment.

"......Hiruzen!!", his master completed the sentence.Orochimaru was disappointed that his plan towards the '<code>Destruction of Konoha</code>' had gone in vain.

Upon hearing the name, Kabuto relaxed a bit as it ensured that his teacher wasn't mad at him.He exhaled deeply to calm his nerves.


He took the key from his pocket and tried to open the door of their lab.To his disappointment, the key didn't work.

Orochimaru was too tired from the epic battle that he had fought with Hiruzen,some 70.0 hours earlier.He remained silent and wanted to rest for a while.

Kabuto got the door to explode using ninja tools.

The entrance was now accessible.The irony of the situation was that,they had to break into their own lab facility.They sighed in a synchronous manner.

</p>
      
<p>

The <code>lab</code> was a modest structure.It was made completely of wood.Inside it, one could find two rooms.One of them was the living area.The other contained an arrangement of 12 '<code>cells</code>'.

Each cell held a human body and a special liquid that prevented the body from both regaining consiousness and further physical decay.


It was one of many such units set up across the Fire Nation by the rogue-genius Orochimaru and his beloved assistant Kabuto.The primary goal of such labs was to carry out illegal experimentation on humans after restricting them to a pseudo-state.


After taking the much-needed treatment and some subsequent rest,Orochimaru started.

"What's the status of our <code>subjects</code>?"

"Orochimaru-sama,I am afraid that your hands are practically dead", replied Kabuto, trying to change the subject.

There was an intense stare from the other end.Kabuto knew that he had messed up.Without any further delay he said that there was an issue that needed to be addressed.


Orochimaru listened patiently to the problem that his student was elaborating on.After a few thoughtful moments he sighed,shook his head.


"So, where is 'it' now?", he asked.


"Somewhere around this forest area, definitely within a radius of 3 miles from this lab",replied Kabuto citing his concerned guess.

Kabuto knew what was to be done.

"Do not enter this place again without the missing 'subject'.Recover it at the earliest", ordered Orochimaru.

"Right away, sir!", bowed Kabuto and left the lab to begin the search.


Through the woods,he went in search of <code>Hashimaru</code>,the missing subject.As he hopped from one branch to the other, Kabuto used his messenger-bird to ask for help from <code>The Land of Iron</code>:his allies.



      </p>
     <p>


<code>Hashimaru</code> was the name of the missing 'subject'.He was hosting the biological cells of <code>Hashirama Senju</code>-The God, hence was code-named as 'Hashimaru'.The only success among the 12 experiments of the lab.

Containing these '<code>cells</code>' meant that Hashimaru was immortal and had self-healing capabilities.This fact had made him the 'special one'.
Orochimaru couldnot afford to lose him, as he hoped to use Hashimaru as a tool for his upcoming plan:'<code>Destruction of Konoha 2.0</code>'.

    

The exact reason as to why Orochimaru wanted to destroy the Konoha village was known only to himself.Some personal secret.

After his recent failure at this task, he was waiting for redemption.His semi-paralysed body only added to his grief.


The village of Konoha was known as the '<code>The Hidden Leaf</code>'.It was feared by the neighbouring nations due to its powerful <code>ninja</code> tribes.Konoha has always had its share of enemies, it continues to do so and Orochimaru is one of them.


After a tedious search through the thick forest cover for days, Kabuto returned to his lab with some bad news.Hashimaru had already escaped.


Kabuto's silence was well understood.After a while, there was complete silence in the room.



</p>
      <p>

<code>Konoha</code>.


It was close to dusk.At the entrance gate, first entered the silhoutte of the special one-Hashimaru.As he walked further in,he felt a sense of oneness with his surroundings, as if he had returned to his hometown after years.

He could also sense that the village was engulfed in sadness.As he moved through the streets, there were shades of black in every direction.<code>'The Week of Mourning'</code> was nearing its end.

Hashimaru stopped by a <code>dojo</code>,to his right he saw some stone carvings,the first face felt oddly familiar to him.There were four such faces on the hill.He took a moment and later entered the dojo.
        He picked up a <code>wooden sword</code> and tried to swing it in a certain <code>samurai style</code>.He failed at it.
"I need to get better at this", he thought.

 <p> 

     


"There seems to be another issue, Orochimaru-sama", Kabuto began.


"Don't tell me that <code>Hashirama Senju</code> is back....If so,it would take us ages to capture Konoha." Orochimaru's guess was close to what had actually happened.
Afterall, Hashimaru was one of his own experiments.


Kabuto's turn.


"It went something like this........We attacked <code>Konoha</code> recently and killed its leader,<code>Hiruzen</code>.But failed in achieving what we wanted.As per our Plan B, we wanted to use own Samurai squad to attack if needed. Now,the important thing is that the main guy, Hashimaru has managed to escape and we are having trouble finding him."

He wasn't finished yet.

"As there are some bright stars scattered across a dark night, the only good thing for the moment is that, Hashimaru<code>(our special samurai)</code>, would likely take some time to realise that he's actually the <code>second coming of the Senju god-Hashirama</code>.And we need to get him back before that happens."


'Once I get my hands to work again, I'll make Konoha pay big time for sure',thought Orochimaru,he was dead serious.
